# CROWDFUNDING
# Solana Crowdfunding with Anchor

This project is a decentralized crowdfunding application built on Solana using Anchor framework. It allows users to connect their Phantom wallet, donate to existing campaigns, and create their own campaigns. Each user can create only one campaign and withdraw funds if they are the owner of the campaign.

## Features

- Connect Phantom Wallet: Users can connect their Phantom wallet to the application.

- Donate to Campaigns: Users can browse existing campaigns and contribute funds to support them.

- Create a Campaign: Users can create their own crowdfunding campaign, specifying the details such as title, description, funding goal, and duration.

- Campaign Owner Privileges: If a user is the owner of a campaign, they can withdraw the funds once the campaign is successfully completed.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure that you have the following dependencies installed:

- Rust: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install
- Solana CLI: https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools
